#UDJ

UDJ is a social music player. It allows many people to control
a single music player democratically. Checkout the
[UDJ homepage][home] for more information. This is the official
UDJ iPhone App. For more details on actually interacting with
UDJ (so you can do something like creating your own client), see the [UDJ Server Repository][server].

## Who Are You?

The primary developer for the UDJ iPhone app is me, [Matt Graf][mg]. You can contact me via email at __themattgraf@gmail.com__.
UDJ as whole, however, is a team project led by [Kurtis Nusbaum][kln].

## Requirements
The UDJ iPhone is currently using iOS SDK 5.1. You will have to clone the [RestKit][rk] and [ShareKit][shk] repositories since we're making use of both of those frameworks in the iPhone app. Getting those frameworks to work with your Xcode project may not be a very straightforward process so feel free to shoot me an email and I'll help you get everything set up.

## License
UDJ is licensed under the [GPLv2][gpl].

## Questions/Comments?

For the UDJ iPhone app, I've been the sole developer so far. If you have any problems working with the UDJ Xcode project, email me at __themattgraf@gmail.com__. Its possible that there are required files that I've forgotten to add the Git repo so just let me know what you need so I can fix it.

If you have any questions or comments about UDJ in general, feel free to post them to
the [UDJ mailing list][mailing].
