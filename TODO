HOST CLIENT
-Enable seemless playback by queuing up songs that are about to be played.
And what's more, songs should fade into one another. Like a real dj would.
Sync the beat of the new song to the beat of the the one that is currently
playing, fade into new song, then gradual return beat of new song to normal.
-Import iTunes library capability
-Need to be able to handle the current song being changed from another client.
-Need to be able to handle the event being ended from another client.
*Handle song not being added to the server correctly.
*If a song is removed from the library mid event, need to make sure that
the available music, active playlist, and anything else that references the
library table is updated accordingly
*make sure ticket is always up to date
*current syncing model always assumes that a library entry or available 
music entry is successfully and completely added with the server before any
potential delete operations is started. need to enforce this work flow some
how. For instance, don't even allow a syncstatus to change unless it's set to
isSynched. Should be a simple trigger on the database.
* make the enable/disable of the playback widget more reasonable.

ANDROID APP
*IMPORTANT: SWITCH TO HttpsURLConnection. This will give us automatic caching
compression. Also security. Also, this is what the android team is throwing
themselves behind so it will be getting the most attention.
-Users should be able to remove songs they added form the playlist
(You know, say they accidentally double added a song)
-Parties with passwords
-Switch auth dialog to dialog fragment

SERVER
-Maybe If two users add the same song within a certain threshold of oneanother (e.g.
the same song was added by two different users within 10 seconds of one another)
just merge the song requests
-Test exception cases. 
-Test for commands that are being issued to a party that is over.
*Test events with passwords
-Need to do json validation. Make sure it's good json and make sure it looks
like its supposed to (i.e. doesn't have certain attributes missing)
*Validate that the libid's that are being requested to be added to the
active playlist to make sure that they belong to the host of the party.


OVERALL
-Rdio and Spotify integration!!!!!!
-Client spec list (minimum fucntionality for each client, along with optional 
functionality).
