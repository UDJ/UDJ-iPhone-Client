To run this server for testing/debug purposes do the following:

1. First run the resetDebugDB script. First supply a full abosulte file 
path for where you'd like the the udj database to reside. This creates the 
database that UDJ needs. You only need to do this once. 
(note you can continually run this script to reset the database back to it's 
original state. subsequent runnings will not prompt you for the location of 
the databases though).

2. To actually start the server up, run the debugRunServer script. The server
will then be up and you can make http requests to it.
