When changing the state of the event follow these two rules:

1. If the event change occurs before the actions that need to happen as
 a result of the state change in a service, the state should be changed in 
 the calling activity/fragment.

2. If state changes after a service has completed a requested action, the
   state is changed by the service itself.
